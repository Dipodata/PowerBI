About this project

Project:
The scenario for the Maven Northwind Challenge is to work as a BI Developer for Northwind Traders, a multinational import and export company specialising in selling high-quality gourmet food goods to restaurants, cafes, and specialty food merchants worldwide.

The goal is to build a top level KPI dashboard  to provide stakeholders with a rapid understanding of the company's performance in essential areas such as:
- Revenue
- Product performance
- Key customers
- Shipping costs

The dashboard should be designed to expand and accommodate additional data over time.

Data:
This dataset contains seven CSV tables with 2985 records and 28 fields: Data on orders, products, shipping, employees, orders details, customers, and categories.

Task:
- Data collection and preparation
- Querying transforming and loading data
- Data modelling
- Writing DAX measures and calculated column
- Develop compelling reports and visualisation
- Create Interactive dashboard

Insights we can gain from the dashboard

- The total sales for July 2013 through to April 2015 is  $1.35 million, while the total quantity of product sold  was 51,000. The total order was 830.
- The Beverage category accounted for the largest portion of total revenue (21.15% - $286.5 thousand) followed by the Dairy Product category (18.56% - $251.3 thousand).
- The top country in terms of revenue was the USA, with revenue totalling $263.5 thousand followed by Germany ($244.6 thousand). Both countries were also the highest in terms of orders (122 orders each).
- The product that drove the highest revenue was Cote-de-Blaye, which generated $149.9 thousand. The most sold product was Camembert-Pierrot , which sold 1577 units.
- The USA and Germany account for almost half (40%) of Freight. This is understandable since the highest number of orders are from these countries, however the company should review ways to cut costs. A solution might be to negotiate attractive rates with freight partners for these countries in particular.


Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions to optimise their sales and profit:

- Increase the promotion and marketing of the Beverage and Dairy product categories, as they have shown high demand and potential for growth.
- Expand their presence and reach in the US and Germany, as these countries have proven to be a lucrative and loyal market for their products.
- Reward and retain their top customers, such as Quick-Stop, Save-a lot-Market and Ernst Handel, by offering them personalised discounts and loyalty programs.
- Explore new opportunities and partnerships in Europe, as it is an untapped market with potential for growth.
- Increase the inventory and availability of Cote-de-Blaye and Camembert-Pierrot, as they are popular and profitable products among our customers.
- The company should look to cut costs in countries like the USA and Germany. A solution might be to negotiate attractive rates with freight partners for these countries in particular.
